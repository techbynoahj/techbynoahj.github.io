            <h2>Why I prefer Dogs over cats</h2>
            <p>I've always thought dogs are so enthusiastic and they are the most heartwarming pets ever. If your sad then they are always there to make you happy. I think they are super cute and cuddly. They are always willing to play with you and they have lots of energy. They are also very protective. If you ever have a child, that dog will guard it with his life. No more home intruders once they see a giant dog like a pitbill or a great dane. Even a chihuahua will feel like he's the biggest dog out there. Me personally, it would be amaing to have a german shepard.</p>
